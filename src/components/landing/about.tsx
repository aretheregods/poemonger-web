                            I'm Warren Christopher Taylor. And this is why I
                            changed my poetry

                        <li>
                            We admitted that we were powerless over how much
                            free verse poetry sucks.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Came to believe that rhythm greater than free verse
                            can restore poetry to sanity.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Made a decision to turn poetry over to rhythm, rhyme
                            and structure as we understood poetry.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Made a searching inventory of what we really like
                            about poetry.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Admitted to ourselves the exact nature of how
                            contemporary poetry sucks.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Were entirely ready to have Poemonger's poetry show
                            all that's wrong with poetry.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Humbly enjoy poemonger's poems so much that we want
                            to change contemporary poetry.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Made a list of everything we love about poetry and
                            became willing to use it in real poetry.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Made direct amends to write rhythmic and fun poetry
                            real, actual people would enjoy.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Continue to take inventory of every word we write
                            and hear when it has no rhythm, logic or beauty at
                            all.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Sought through having real people read our poems to
                            find out that people actually love fun, rhythmic
                            poetry with understandable and logical stories to
                            tell.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Having had a poetic awakening as a result of
                            Poemonger, we tried to carry this message of
                            poetry's rhythm and possibilities to poets and all
                            people.
